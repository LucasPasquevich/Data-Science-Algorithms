# Data-Science-Algorithms
Hi! ItÂ´s my porfolio/repository of Data Science proyects. 
Here you can find this folds:

- KNN_LR_NB_Cluster: Is a proyect of Stars, Galaxys and Quasars classification using K-NN, Linear Regression and Naive Bayes algorithms. 
Additionally I applied and explained clustering algorithms (K-means, hierarchical and DBSCAN) for practice, 
as you can see in the code it did not give anything reasonable either.

- Linear Regresion (S-PLUS): Is a regression proyect to predict galaxy redshift. Here I use a classical Linear Regression and a Random Forest Regression
algorithm.
